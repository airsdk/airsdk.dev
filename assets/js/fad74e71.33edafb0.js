Shared objects, like other\nmedia in Flash Player, are partitioned into security sandboxes. However, the\nsandbox model for shared objects is somewhat different, because shared objects\nare not resources that can ever be accessed across domain boundaries. Instead,\nshared objects are always retrieved from a shared object store that is\nparticular to the domain of each SWF file that calls methods of the SharedObject\nclass. Usually a shared object store is even more particular than a SWF file's\ndomain: by default, each SWF file uses a shared object store particular to its\nentire origin URL.
