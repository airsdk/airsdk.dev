[Download](https://airsdk.harman.com/download/33.1.1.713)\\n\\n\\n\\n## Changes and Issues\\n3.1 Changes in this Release  \\n\\n### 3.1.1 Runtime  \\nNo changes \u2013 the below details will be fixed for all \u201c33.1\u201d version numbers:  \\nNamespace: 33.1  \\nSWF version: 44  \\n  \\nThe namespace and SWF version updates are made across all platforms and may be used to access the\\nupdated ActionScript APIs that will be introduced in future beta releases of 33.1.\\nNote that using \u201c33.0\u201d as a namespace is not valid, and is resulting in behaviors such as VerifyErrors being\\ndispatched at application start-up with built-in class names such as ExtensionContext, Context3D, and others.\\n  \\n### 3.1.2 Build Tools  \\nXcode 13 and the latest macOS and iphoneOS SDKs are now being used to build the AIR SDK.\\nThe build system for this is on a version of macOS that doesn\u2019t support 32-bit processes hence we cannot\\ngenerate the 32-bit versions of the stub files.
