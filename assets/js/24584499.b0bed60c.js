for all \u201c33.1\u201d version numbers:  \\nNamespace: 33.1  \\nSWF version: 44  \\n  \\nThe namespace and SWF version updates are made across all platforms and may be used to access the\\nupdated ActionScript APIs that will be introduced in future beta releases of 33.1.\\nNote that using \u201c33.0\u201d as a namespace is not valid, and is resulting in behaviors such as VerifyErrors being\\ndispatched at application start-up with built-in class names such as ExtensionContext, Context3D, and others.\\n  \\n### 3.1.2 Build Tools  \\nXcode 13 and the latest macOS and iphoneOS SDKs are now being used to build the AIR SDK.\\nThe build system for this is on a version of macOS that doesn\u2019t support 32-bit processes hence we cannot\\ngenerate the 32-bit versions of the stub files. This means that we can no longer support older 32-bit\\niPhone/iPad devices.\\n  \\n### 3.1.3 AS3 APIs  \\nUpdated AS3 APIs are described in section 12.\\n  \\n### 3.1.4 Features  \\ngithub-1432: Updating version of ADB to 1.0.41 to match recent Android platform-tools\\n  \\n### 3.1.5 Bug Fixes  \\ngithub-274: Updating Java bytecode generator to cope with Android styleable resources  \\ngithub-444: Allow additional languages to be used in AIR mobile apps  \\ngithub-1368: Failed to package Android APK using Java 17  \\ngithub-1392: Ensuring utf-8 based Android resources can be compiled with javac  \\ngithub-1405: Failed to package Android AAB using Java 17  \\ngithub-1409: Ensuring jarsigner process uses quotes around arguments and correct relative paths  \\ngithub-1418: Ensuring default APK build is targeting armv7  \\ngithub-1424: Ensuring correct ANE .so files are placed in the correct ABI subfolders  \\ngithub-1426: Gradle java process to use the higher of ADT memory vs config setting  \\ngithub-1429: APKs generated without legacy build mode will include all ABIs  \\ngithub-1430: ADT failing to launch an Android application when using new build mechanism  \\ngithub-1431: Better error handling for invalid license files  \\nAIR-5449: AIR Android packaging using ADT should work with compatible major/minor AIR releases"},{"id":"/2021/12/02/new-air-release","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/2021/12/02/new-air-release","source":"@site/news/2021-12-02-new-air-release.md","title":"Release 33.1.1.698","description":"AIR Runtime 33.1.1.698 has been released by Harman.","date":"2021-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 2, 2021","tags":[{"label":"airsdk","permalink":"/news/tags/airsdk"},{"label":"updates","permalink":"/news/tags/updates"}],"readingTime":1.915,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jan","title":"Developer at Dallmeier electronic GmbH","url":"https://github.com/2jfw","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73781224?v=4"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Release 33.1.1.698","author":"Jan","author_title":"Developer at Dallmeier electronic GmbH","author_url":"https://github.com/2jfw","author_image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73781224?v=4","tags":["airsdk","updates"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Release 33.1.1.713","permalink":"/news/2021/12/14/new-air-release"},"nextItem":{"title":"Community and Showcase Sections","permalink":"/news/2021/10/14/new-additions"}},"content":"**AIR Runtime 33.1.1.698** has been released by Harman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n- [Release Notes](https://airsdk.harman.com/api/versions/33.1.1.698/release-notes/Release_Notes_AIR_SDK_33.1.1.698.pdf)\\r\\n- [Download](https://airsdk.harman.com/download/33.1.1.698)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Changes and Issues\\r\\n3.1 Changes in this Release  \\r\\n\\r\\n### 3.1.1 Runtime  \\r\\nNo changes \u2013 the below details will be fixed for all \u201c33.1\u201d version numbers:  \\r\\nNamespace: 33.1  \\r\\nSWF version: 44  \\r\\n  \\r\\nThe namespace and SWF version updates are made across all platforms and may be used to access the\\r\\nupdated ActionScript APIs that will be introduced in future beta releases of 33.1.\\r\\nNote that using \u201c33.0\u201d as a namespace is not valid, and is resulting in behaviors such as VerifyErrors being\\r\\ndispatched at application start-up with built-in class names such as ExtensionContext, Context3D, and others.\\r\\n  \\r\\n### 3.1.2 Build Tools  \\r\\nXcode 13 and the latest macOS and iphoneOS SDKs are now being used to build the AIR SDK.\\r\\nThe build system for this is on a version of macOS that doesn\u2019t support 32-bit processes hence we cannot\\r\\ngenerate the 32-bit versions of the stub files.
