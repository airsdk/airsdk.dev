It\u2019s easy to make something repeat in ActionScript, using a common looping statement. However, a loop will run through all its iterations before updating the display.

Each display object has an enterFrame event that is dispatched according to the frame rate of the SWF file\u2014one event per frame. Most developers who create scripted animation use the enterFrame event as a way to create actions that repeat over time.
