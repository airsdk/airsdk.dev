# About AIR

Adobe® AIR® is a multi-operating system, multi-screen runtime that allows you to leverage your web development skills to build and deploy rich Internet applications (RIAs) to the desktop and mobile devices. Desktop, television, and mobile AIR applications can be built with ActionScript 3.0 using Adobe® Flex and Adobe® Flash® (SWF based). Desktop AIR applications can also be built with HTML, JavaScript®, and Ajax (HTML based).

This site is the main portal for getting started with and using Adobe AIR.

AIR enables you to work in familiar environments, to leverage the tools and approaches you find most comfortable. By supporting Actionscript, Flex, HTML, and JavaScript, you can build the best possible experience that meets your needs.

**When developing applications for AIR, you can leverage a rich set of frameworks and APIs:**

- APIs specific to AIR provided by the runtime and the AIR framework;
- ActionScript APIs used in SWF files and Flex framework (as well as other ActionScript based libraries and frameworks);
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript;
- Native extensions (ANEs), which provide ActionScript APIs that provide you access to platform-specific functionality programmed in native code. Native extensions can also provide access to legacy native code, and native code that provides higher performance.

AIR dramatically changes how applications can be created, deployed, and experienced. You gain more creative control and can extend your Actionscript, Flex, HTML, and Ajax-based applications to the desktop, mobile devices, and televisions.
