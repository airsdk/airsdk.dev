The ADT `-help` command displays a terse reminder of the command-line options:

```
adt -help
```

The help output uses the following symbolic conventions:

- `<>` — items between angle brackets indicate information that you must provide.

- `()` — items within parentheses indicate options that are treated as a group in the help command output.

- `ALL_CAPS` — items spelled out in capital letters indicate a set of options that is described separately.

- `|` — `OR`. For example, ( A | B ), means item A or item B.

- `?` — 0 or 1. A question mark following an item indicates that an item is optional and that only one instance can occur, if used.

- `*` — 0 or more. An asterisk following an item indicates that an item is optional and that any number of instances can occur.

- `+` — 1 or more. A plus sign following an item indicates that an item is required and that multiple instances can occur.

- no symbol — If an item has no suffix symbol, then that item is required and only one instance can occur.
