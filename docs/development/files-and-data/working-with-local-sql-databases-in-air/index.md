# Working with local SQL databases in AIR

Adobe® AIR® includes the capability of creating and working with local SQL
databases. The runtime includes a SQL database engine with support for many
standard SQL features, using the open source SQLite database system. A local SQL
database can be used for storing local, persistent data. For example, it can be
used for application data, application user settings, documents, or any other
type of data that you want your application to save locally.
