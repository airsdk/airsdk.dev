# Handling Events

An event-handling system allows programmers to respond to user input and system
events in a convenient way. The ActionScript 3.0 event model is not only
convenient, but also standards-compliant, and well integrated with the display
list. Based on the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Events Specification, an
industry-standard event-handling architecture, the new event model provides a
powerful yet intuitive event-handling tool for ActionScript programmers.

The ActionScript 3.0 event-handling system interacts closely with the display
list. To gain a basic understanding of the display list, read
[Display programming](../../display/index.md).
