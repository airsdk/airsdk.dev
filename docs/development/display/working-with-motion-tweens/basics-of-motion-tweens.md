# Basics of Motion Tweens

Motion tweens provide an easy way to create animation.

A motion tween modifies display object properties, such as position or rotation,
on a frame-to-frame basis. A motion tween can also change the appearance of a
display object while it moves by applying various filters and other properties.
You create the motion tween interactively with Flash Professional, which
generates the ActionScript for the motion tween. From within Flash, use the Copy
Motion as ActionScript 3.0 command to copy the ActionScript that created the
motion tween. Then you can reuse the ActionScript to create movement in your own
dynamic animation at runtime.

See the Motion Tweens section in _Using Flash Professional_ for information
about creating a motion tween.
