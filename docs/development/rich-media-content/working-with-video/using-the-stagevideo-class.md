# Using the StageVideo class for hardware accelerated presentation

Flash Player optimizes video performance by using hardware acceleration for
H.264 decoding. You can enhance performance further by using the StageVideo API.
Stage video lets your application take advantage of hardware accelerated
presentation.

Runtimes that support the StageVideo API include:

- Flash Player 10.2 and later

Note: In Flash Player 11.4/AIR 3.4 and higher, you can use camera input with
StageVideo.
