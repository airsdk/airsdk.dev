# Working with sound

ActionScript is made for immersive, interactive applications—and one often
overlooked element of powerfully immersive applications is sound. You can add
sound effects to a video game, audio feedback to an application user interface,
or even make a program that analyzes mp3 files loaded over the Internet, with
sound at the core of the application.

You can load external audio files and work with audio that's embedded in a SWF.
You can control the audio, create visual representations of the sound
information, and capture sound from a user's microphone.
