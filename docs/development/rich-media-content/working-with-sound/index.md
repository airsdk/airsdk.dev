ActionScript is made for immersive, interactive applications—and one often overlooked element of powerfully immersive applications is sound. You can add sound effects to a video game, audio feedback to an application user interface, or even make a program that analyzes mp3 files loaded over the Internet, with sound at the core of the application.

You can load external audio files and work with audio that’s embedded in a SWF. You can control the audio, create visual representations of the sound information, and capture sound from a user’s microphone.
