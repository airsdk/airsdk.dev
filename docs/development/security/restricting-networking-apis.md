# Restricting networking APIs

Networking APIs can be restricted in two ways. To prevent malicious activity,
access to commonly reserved ports is blocked; you can't override these blocks in
your code. To control a SWF file's access to network functionality with regard
to other ports, you can use the `allowNetworking` setting.

## Blocked ports

Flash Player and Adobe AIR have restrictions on HTTP access to certain ports, as
do browsers. HTTP requests are not permitted to certain standard ports that are
conventionally used for non-HTTP types of servers.

Any API that accesses a network URL is subject to these port blocking
restrictions. The only exception is APIs that call sockets directly, such as
`Socket.connect()` and `XMLSocket.connect()`, or calls to
`Security.loadPolicyFile()` in which a socket policy file is being loaded.
Socket connections are permitted or denied through the use of socket policy
files on the target server.

The following list shows the ActionScript 3.0 APIs to which port blocking
applies:

`FileReference.download(),` `FileReference.upload()`, `Loader.load()`,
`Loader.loadBytes()`, `navigateToURL()`, `NetConnection.call()`,
`NetConnection.connect()`, `NetStream.play()`, `Security.loadPolicyFile()`,
`sendToURL()`, `Sound.load()`, `URLLoader.load()`, `URLStream.load()`

Port blocking also applies to Shared Library importing, the use of the `<img>`
tag in text fields, and the loading of SWF files in an HTML page using the
`<object>` and `<embed>` tags.

Port blocking also applies to the use of the `<img>` tag in text fields and the
loading of SWF files in an HTML page using the `<object>` and `<embed>` tags.

The following lists show which ports are blocked:

4045 (lockd), 6000 (x11)

## Using the allowNetworking parameter

You can control a SWF file's access to network functionality by setting the
`allowNetworking` parameter in the `<object>` and `<embed>` tags in the HTML
page that contains the SWF content.

Possible values of `allowNetworking` are:

- `"all"` (the default)—All networking APIs are permitted in the SWF file.

- `"internal"` —The SWF file may not call browser navigation or browser
  interaction APIs, listed later in this section, but it may call any other
  networking APIs.

- `"none"` —The SWF file may not call browser navigation or browser interaction
  APIs, listed later in this section, and it cannot use any SWF-to-SWF
  communication APIs, also listed later.

The `allowNetworking` parameter is designed to be used primarily when the SWF
file and the enclosing HTML page are from different domains. Using the value of
`"internal"` or `"none"` is not recommended when the SWF file being loaded is
from the same domain as its enclosing HTML pages, because you can't ensure that
a SWF file is always loaded with the HTML page you intend. Untrusted parties
could load a SWF file from your domain with no enclosing HTML, in which case the
`allowNetworking` restriction will not work as you intended.

Calling a prevented API throws a SecurityError exception.

Add the `allowNetworking` parameter and set its value in the `<object>` and
`<embed>` tags in the HTML page that contains a reference to the SWF file, as
shown in the following example:

```
<object classic="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000"
	Code base="http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=9,0,124,0"
	width="600" height="400" ID="test" align="middle">
	<param name="allowNetworking" value="none" />
	<param name="movie" value="test.swf" />
	<param name="bgcolor" value="#333333" />
	<embed src="test.swf" allowNetworking="none" bgcolor="#333333"
		width="600" height="400"
		name="test" align="middle" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"
		pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" />
</object>
```

An HTML page may also use a script to generate SWF-embedding tags. You need to
alter the script so that it inserts the proper `allowNetworking` settings. HTML
pages generated by Adobe Flash Professional and Adobe Flash Builder use the
`AC_FL_RunContent()` function to embed references to SWF files. Add the
`allowNetworking` parameter settings to the script, as in the following:

```
AC_FL_RunContent( ... "allowNetworking", "none", ...)
```

The following APIs are prevented when `allowNetworking` is set to `"internal"`:

`navigateToURL()`, `fscommand()`, `ExternalInterface.call()`

In addition to the APIs on the previous list, the following APIs are also
prevented when `allowNetworking` is set to `"none"`:

`sendToURL()`, `FileReference.download()`, `FileReference.upload()`,
`Loader.load()`, `LocalConnection.connect()`, `LocalConnection.send()`,
`NetConnection.connect()`, `NetStream.play()`, `Security.loadPolicyFile()`,
`SharedObject.getLocal()`, `SharedObject.getRemote()`, `Socket.connect()`,
`Sound.load()`, `URLLoader.load()`, `URLStream.load()`, `XMLSocket.connect()`

Even if the selected `allowNetworking` setting permits a SWF file to use a
networking API, there may be other restrictions based on security sandbox
limitations (see [Security sandboxes](./security-sandboxes.md)).

When `allowNetworking` is set to `"none"`, you cannot reference external media
in an `<img>` tag in the `htmlText` property of a TextField object (a
SecurityError exception is thrown).

When `allowNetworking` is set to `"none"`, a symbol from an imported shared
library added in the Flash Professional (not ActionScript) is blocked at run
time.
