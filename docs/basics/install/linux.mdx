## System Requirements

To install and run AIR your development environment must meet these minimum requirements:

- Linux
- 1.3GB free disk space (for the AIR SDK and does not include other tools)
- A version of Java:
   - Minimum: JDK 11
   - Recommended: [JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) or [JDK 21](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk21-archive-downloads.html)


## Install the SDK 

You have two options to install the AIR SDK. The recommended method is to use the AIR SDK Manager. The manager will inform you of available updates and minimise the download required for each update.

Alternatively you can manually download the AIR SDK. 

<Tabs
  groupId="airsdkmanager"
  defaultValue="airsdkmanager"
  values={[
    {label: 'AIR SDK Manager', value: 'airsdkmanager'},
    {label: 'Manual', value: 'manual'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="airsdkmanager" >


1. Download the latest release bundle of the AIR SDK Manager:

<AIRSDKManagerDownload platform="linux" />

2. Unzip the application to your preferred location and run the `AIRSDKManager` executable. 

3. Once installed, set the **AIR SDKs Location** on your machine. 

:::note AIR SDK Location
This location will be where the AIR SDK Manager installs versions of the AIR SDK. This can be an existing directory of AIR SDKs however it is recommended to select a new location, eg `/Users/<your-user-name>/sdks/air`

The manager will construct a directory for each major version of the AIR SDK (eg `AIRSDK_50.2.1`), with point releases just be considered as updates.

4. Select one of the available SDK versions and click the gear icon to **Install** the SDK. Once installed you can click **Locate** to locate the installation.

### Architecture

The AIR SDK has a different implementation for x86 (64bit) and ARM systems. The architecture will be set automatically when you download an SDK through the AIR SDK Manager.

<TabItem value="manual" >

1. Download the latest release bundle of the AIR SDK:

<AIRSDKDownload platform="linux" />

> For older versions see the [SDK releases](https://airsdk.harman.com/release_notes) page.

2. Extract the bundle in the desired location, for example:

```shell
cd ~/sdks/air
unzip ~/Downloads/AIRSDK_Linux.zip -d AIRSDK_XX.X.X
```

### Architecture

The AIR SDK has a different implementation for x86 (64bit) and ARM systems.

By default the AIR SDK uses x86 (64bit) version of the tools however if you are running on an ARM based system you will need to use the ARM version of the SDK.

To do this you will need to run the following command:

```shell
cd ~/sdks/air/AIRSDK_XX.X.X
./bin/configure_linux.sh arm64
```


</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Set your Environment

Next you will want to add the AIR SDK tools to your path so you can execute the build commands.

1. Permanently adding the path will depend on the shell you are using on your machine. Typing `echo $SHELL` in your Terminal will generally tell you which sheel you are using and then you can edit the `rc` file for that shell type, the most common types are:

- `/bin/bash`: Edit the `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` file
- `/bin/zsh`: Edit the `.zshrc` file

2. Once you have determined the shell type add the following changing the `[AIR_SDK_PATH]` to be the path you extracted the AIR SDK to above:

```shell
export AIR_HOME=[AIR_SDK_PATH]
export PATH="${PATH}":"${AIR_HOME}/bin"
```

3. Run `source ~/.<rc file>` or start a new Terminal window to refresh the environment.

4. Verify the AIR SDK `bin` directory is in your path by running:

```shell
echo $PATH
```

Verify you can access the AIR SDK commands by running:

```shell
which adt adl
```

:::note
You can check the version of the AIR SDK by running

```shell
adt -version
```

### Java

You must make sure you have the Java Developmet Kit (JDK) installed and that your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set to the JDK's folder. 

We currently recommend using Java 17 but check the release notes for any changes.
