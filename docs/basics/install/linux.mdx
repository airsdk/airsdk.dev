## System Requirements

To install and run AIR your development environment must meet these minimum requirements:

- Linux
- 1.3GB free disk space (for the AIR SDK and does not include other tools)
- A version of Java 8

## Download the SDK

1. Download the latest release bundle of the AIR SDK:

<AIRSDKDownload platform="linux" />

> For older versions see the [SDK releases](https://airsdk.harman.com/release_notes) page.

2. Extract the bundle in the desired location, for example:

```shell
cd ~/sdks/air
unzip ~/Downloads/AIRSDK_Linux.zip
```

## Set your Environment

Next you will want to add the AIR SDK tools to your path so you can execute the build commands.

1. Permanently adding the path will depend on the shell you are using on your machine. Typing `echo $SHELL` in your Terminal will generally tell you which sheel you are using and then you can edit the `rc` file for that shell type, the most common types are:

- `/bin/bash`: Edit the `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` file
- `/bin/zsh`: Edit the `.zshrc` file

2. Once you have determined the shell type add the following changing the `[AIR_SDK_PATH]` to be the path you extracted the AIR SDK to above:

```shell
export AIR_HOME=[AIR_SDK_PATH]
export PATH="${PATH}":"${AIR_HOME}/bin"
```

3. Run `source ~/.<rc file>` or start a new Terminal window to refresh the environment.

4. Verify the AIR SDK `bin` directory is in your path by running:

```shell
echo $PATH
```

Verify you can access the AIR SDK commands by running:

```shell
which adt adl
```

:::note
You can check the version of the AIR SDK by running

```shell
adt -version
```

### Java

You must make sure you have version of Java 8 installed and that your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set to the JDKâ€™s folder.
